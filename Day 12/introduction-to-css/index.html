     <!-- this is an example of embedded (internaL) styles for a Page
    this requires the style tag within the head area
    this is not best Practice

    doing embedded styling, unless explicitly asked for, with lose you marks

    you can placed all you styling with the tag area
    remember if this is global to your entire web site, then you would need
        to place this code on each page, bad maintenance!!!! 
        
    the sample coding on one line is NOT good practice and will also lose
        you marks-->

    <!-- <style>
        .special-hightlight {color: #f4ec07; font-style: italic;}
    </style> -->

    <!-- 
        to use a css file within your web page, you must link the file
            using a link tag

        for a css file
          rel attribute will be stylesheet
          href attribute will be a relative address to the style sheet

        you can link to external css style sheets in which case you will
            be using an http: url 
        common set of style is from a 3rd party called bootstrap (you are NOT to use this
                site in this course)

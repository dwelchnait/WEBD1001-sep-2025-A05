                we need to reference the h3 sections of the top 6 dishes without
                    touching the sections in the other subtopics

                we can attempt to use direct descendant selectors in the css, however,
                    this does not isolate the sections of top-dishes

                solution: think outside the box

                consider using a class name (unique) to "label" the selected area of
                    your page
                you can then use the class name and lower element selectors to isolate
                    the hmtl elements you wish

                ex: the top 6 dishes were encapsulated under the class name top-dishes
                    now the sections under top-dishes can be referred to without touching
                    the other subtopics
            -->

                <!-- enscapsulate all the next 6 sections to be affected by a
                        single flexbox
                     since the is natural selection to add the flex-container, we
                        use the div tag to group (enscapsulate) the items (flex-items)
                        within the desired flex-box-->

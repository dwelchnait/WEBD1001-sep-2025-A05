                    <p>Edmonton is known as Canada's ""Festival City" for good reason,

                    <h3>Elk IsLand National Park</h3>
                    <p>Elk Island National Park, just 35 - 48km east of Edmonton, is a
                        true gem of Canadian conservation, history, and wildlife viewing.</p>
                    <p>Originally created in 1906 as an elk preserve, Elk Park became
                        Canada's first wildlife refuge and was designated a national
                        park in 1913.</p>

                    <p>Edmonton's iconic Riverboat, known today simply as the Edmonton
                        Riverboat, has been delighting locals and visitors since its debut
                        in 1995 (originally named the Edmonton Queen).</p>
                    <p>Built locally and stretching about 52m long, it carries nearly
                        400 passengers aboard a charming paddle-wheeler along the
                        North Saskatchewan River during the warmer months.</p>

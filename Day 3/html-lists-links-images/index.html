        <h2>HTML Errors and Validation</h2>

        <h3>using W3C service site</h3>

        <p>HTML markup follows specific standards and rules to display correctly. 
            It's common to make syntax or logical errors when writing your code. 
            An HTML validation service will analyze your markup, identify any errors or warnings, 
            and provide feedback to help you understand how to fix the issues.</p>

        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Validation Service</a>

        <p>Using the 'Direct Input' tab within the W3C Validator, see if you can find and correct the error with the
            following code. Afterwards, validate the entire .html file and correct any other issues.</p>

        <h3>Visual Studio Code Extension</h3>

        <p>Another way to validate your code is to add an extension into your VSC. The extension is W3C Web Validator. 
            Once installed, a icon/text will appear in your lower left corner (checkmark W3C validation). Simply open the 
            html file of interest and press the button.</p>



        <h3>Common Types of HTML Errors:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing closing tags</li>
            <li>Incorrect tag usage</li>
            <li>Missing or incorrect usage of attributes</li>
            <li>Improper nesting</li>
            <li>Typos</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Figure and Table Elements</h1>
        <h2>What is the figure element and why use it?</h2>
        <p>The figure element represents some flow content, 
        optionally with a caption, that is self-contained 
        (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced as a 
        single unit from the main flow of the document.</p>
        <p>It is a semantic tag that tells the browser that these 
            items have a relation to each other.</p>
        <p>The figure is the parent element, and the img and 
            figcaption elements are children nested inside.</p>

        <p>Stand-alone image with no caption. Original size is 835 X 557.
            You can alter the display size by simply changing your
            width and height attributes.
        </p>

        <h4>Using Fiqure and caption around an image</h4>
          <!-- 
        using a caption with an image
        structure:    figure
                        img (you can have as many images as you wish)
                        [figcaption]
                      figure
        the figcaption can be place before or after your image
        Even though you COULD place a caption before and after your image, it does NOT
           mean your should. If you do try, you will discover that the W3C validator will
           object to having multiple captions within your figure tag!!!!!

        <h2>HTML Tables</h2>   
        <p>The table element represents data with more than one dimension, 
        in the form of a table.</p>

        <!--
            The table tag has several internal tags used to create the table structure.
            Some are required others are optional

            <p>This is an example of a html form. It will demonstrate some of
                the basic form elements such as input, select, textarea,fieldset,
                legend and submit button.

            </p>
            <!--Warning
                It appears the Go Live does not nicel play with form submission
                It appears that we will need to execute the form submission
                    by starting the web page from our File Explorer by 
                    double clicking the index file-->
            
            <!-- all form element will appear between these two tags-->
            <!-- action: indicates the page to send the form for processing
                        can stay on same page by using the # symbol-->
            <!-- method: dictates on the send the entered data
                get: data will be display in text on your url
                    sent as a name/value pair eg: idname=thedatavalue
                post: data will be encapsulated with the page itself and
                    not be display on your url-->

                    this is similar to the input type text.

                        some input controls can be logically group together to act as
                        as single overall control. The prime example of this is the
                        radiobutton control. The radiobutton control allows a single
                        selection from a group of input controls.

                        NOTE: the name on each input control MUST be the same for the
                              radio button group

                        Each choice in the select control is indicated by a option set

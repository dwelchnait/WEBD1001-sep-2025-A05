             become part of your web page outline.-->

                    <p>Camber Coffee is my go-to spot every morning. The staff are always welcoming, 
                        and the espresso is consistently perfect. I love the cozy atmosphere—it's 
                        the kind of place where you can actually relax or get work done. Highly recommend 
                        the seasonal drinks!</p>

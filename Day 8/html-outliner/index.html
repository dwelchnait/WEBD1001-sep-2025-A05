            when creating your web pages, you are expected to use
            appropriate semantic and landmark tags
            landmark tags (header, main, footer)
            semantic tags (section, article and aside)
        -->
        <!--
            outlines are generated using your hn tags (h1-h6)
            only 1 h1 per page
            multiple h2-h6 tags per page
            nesting of tags should increase by 1 
                example: nested tags under an h2 would be h3
            all semantic tags are expected to have a hn tag
            outlines are NOT relient on semantic tags

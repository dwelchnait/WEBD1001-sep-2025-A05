             <!-- Use relative paths when linking to other pages or assets in the project 
                    folder. -->
            <!-- Relative paths start from the current directory and help 
                        ensure portability when the site is moved to a server. -->
            <!-- Since index.html, shop.html, and about-us.html are in the root folder, 
                        we can link to them directly. -->

            <!-- semantic tag to indicate navigation: nav tag
                 typically this semantic tag does NOT has a h tag
                 typically when moving from paga to page within your web site,
                    you do not go to a new tab
                 Typically when moving to an off site location, it is a nice practice
                    to open the page in an new bowser tab
                
                to stay on the same page you can either:
                  use the # tag
                  use the page name
